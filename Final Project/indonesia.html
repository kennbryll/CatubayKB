	<p>Indonesia is battling forest fires causing toxic haze across Southeast Asia with aircraft, artificial rain and even prayer, President Joko Widodo said during a visit to one of the worst-affected areas. Forest fires are raging on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra, sending a choking smog across the region -including towards neighbours Malaysia and Singapore. During a visit to Riau province in central Sumatra on Tuesday, Widodo said nearly 6,000 troops had been sent to hotspots to help put out fires. "We have made every effort," he said. As well as firefighters on the ground, dozens of aircraft were being used for cloud-seeding to stimulate rain and for water-bombing the flames, he said. "We have also prayed," he added, after a visit to Amrulloh Mosque in Pekanbaru. The toxic smoke caused by deliberate burning to clear land for plantations is an annual problem for Indonesia and its neighbours but has been worsened this year by particularly dry weather.</p>
