		<p>While wildfires are not a serious threat to the Philippines, air pollution is a year-round perennial problem in the country. A 2018 World Health Organization (WHO) report found that the Philippines ranked third in the world as having the most number of deaths due to air pollution (after China and Mongolia). One in four deaths in the Philippines are attributed to air pollution. When the size of particulate matter in the air is 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) and below, it penetrates into a person’s respiratory and cardiovascular system leading to serious health problems such as pulmonary disease, lung cancer, pneumonia, heart disease and stroke.</p>
		
		<p>UNICEF’s Air Pollution Report says that outdoor air pollution is most common in low-income, urban areas and is caused by vehicle emissions, heavy use of fossil fuels, dust, and burning of waste. In the Philippines, air pollution is a problem that cuts among demographics, affecting rich and poor people alike.</p>

		<p>One of the largest sources of carbon monoxide in the Philippines are vehicle emissions. The emissions problem in the Philippines is compounded by old, inefficient vehicles that continue to ply the streets. A 2003 air pollution study by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) also found that a large fraction of Metro Manila’s vehicle emission sources includes motorcycles with inefficient two-stroke engines.</p>

		<p>The ADB study’s recommendations included a pilot program for retrofitting particulate traps on diesel vehicles. Solving the Philippines’ air pollution problems would require a host of solutions — jeepney modernization, mandatory phaseout of old/fuel-inefficient vehicles, incentives for hybrid vehicles, construction of mass transit systems, strict enforcement of the Clean Air Act, and other regulatory measures related to non-vehicle sources of air pollution.</p>

		<p>Undoubtedly, these solutions take time to implement. While the Philippines tries to go down the global ranking of having the third highest deaths caused by air pollution, it should take a precautionary approach to protect the health of Filipinos in the same way that California has been doing for its residents. There should be heightened awareness through information dissemination, public announcements through the news or social media, regular updates on air quality, advisories on when to avoid outdoor activities (when APM or PM2.5 are at hazardous levels), and provision of masks as a health intervention (particularly for those publicly commuting in highly polluted areas).</p>

		<p>While air is necessary for survival, breathing in polluted air is a threat to the health and existence of humans. It’s a risk that Filipinos should be aware of, and most Filipinos are exposed to this risk everyday even without wildfires in the country.</p>
